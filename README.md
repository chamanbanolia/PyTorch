# PyTorch
My PyTorch Fresco Learning Workspace

## PyTorch:
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a Python-based library built by Facebook's Artificial Intelligence research group.
* It is a based on machine learning package called Torch used in Lua programming language.

### Key Features
* `PyTorch` is similar to scientific computing library, NumPy, in terms of workflow and flexibility.
* Here are some of the critical features of PyTorch:
  * **Ease of Use** - Tensor operations are close to NumPy and have excellent documentation.
  * **Python Support** - One of the most extensive open source library, and PyTorch provides an implementation for almost all the computations in deep learning.
  * **Dynamic graph computation** - Unlike TensorFlow, Computational graphs can be defined and changed at runtime.
  
### Installation
* You can install PyTorch using pip install as shown below assuming that you are using Python 3.
```
pip install torch torchvision
```
* You can find more details on installation [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
